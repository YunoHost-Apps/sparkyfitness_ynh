# --- Backend Server Settings ---
# The hostname or IP address of the backend server.
# For Docker Compose, this is typically the service name (e.g., 'sparkyfitness-server').
# For local development or other deployments, this might be 'localhost' or a specific IP.
SPARKY_FITNESS_SERVER_HOST=127.0.0.1
# The external port the server will be exposed on.

HOST=127.0.0.1
PORT=__PORT__

# The public URL of your frontend (e.g., https://fitness.example.com). This is crucial for CORS security.
# For local development, use http://localhost:8080. For production, use your domain with https.

# Logging level for the server (e.g., INFO, DEBUG, WARN, ERROR)

# Node.js environment mode (e.g., development, production, test)
# Set to 'production' for deployment to ensure optimal performance and security.

# Server timezone. Use a TZ database name (e.g., 'America/New_York', 'Etc/UTC').
# This affects how dates/times are handled by the server if not explicitly managed in code.

# --- Security Settings ---
# A 64-character hex string for data encryption. 
# You can generate a secure key with the following command:
# openssl rand -hex 32

SPARKY_FITNESS_API_ENCRYPTION_KEY=__SPARKY_KEY__

# A secret key for signing JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). Make this a long, random, and secure string.

# openssl rand -base64 32
# or 
# node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"

# Set to 'true' to disable new user registrations.

# --- Login Management Fail-Safe ---
# Set to 'true' to force email/password login to be enabled, overriding any in-app settings.
